This project is a Sports Celebrity Image Classification Model that implements machine learning techniques to classify images of five sports personalities. Using the OpenCV library, the project performs face and eye detection for data cleaning, followed by feature engineering using wavelet transforms. The model is built using Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Random Forest, with hyperparameter tuning conducted through GridSearchCV to optimize performance. This classification system can be utilized for sports analytics, fan engagement, or automated tagging in sports media.
